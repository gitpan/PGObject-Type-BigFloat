PGObject-Type-BigFloat

The PGObject::Module::BigFloat module provides a PGObject-aware wrapper around 
Math::BigFloat.  This can then be the basis of "double-facing" classes sitting 
between user interfaces and the database.  Once registered (optionally in a
registry, which must already exist), it grabs all NUMERIC and FLOAT types and 
returns these as Math::BigFloat-compatible objects.

INSTALLATION
